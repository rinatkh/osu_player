# osu_player
Hi, this is a bot in the osu game.

This program use OpenCV.h , thread.h libraries. So you need to install these libraries here (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html,  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35932258/how-to-install-libpthread-a-in-ubuntu-14-04) 

after your installation, you need to use cmake for linking(https://habr.com/ru/post/155467/)
open the program in terminal of Ubuntu such as "./osu_player" and open the app OSU

Enjoy!
